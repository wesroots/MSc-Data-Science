# Pre-Reading Directory
This directory contains preparatory study material completed prior to the MSc Data Science programme.

It serves as a structured foundation in programming and mathematical methods essential for the taught modules.

All changes made locally in Obsidian are automatically committed and pushed to this GitHub repository using the integrated **Git Obsidian plugin**, ensuring continuous synchronisation between local and remote versions.

## Folder Structure

### 1. Python for Data Science/
- Progressive topic notes (`.md` files) covering Python fundamentals through to intermediate programming concepts.  
- Topics include:
	- Programming basics, control flow, and data structures.  
	- User-defined functions, error handling, and file management.  
	- Modules, packages, and object-oriented programming (OOP).  
	- Functional tools, comprehension, and debugging workflows.  
- Designed to build syntactic fluency and conceptual understanding before the Python Programming module.

### 2. Mathematics for Data Science/
- Comprehensive notes organised by mathematical domain:
	- **M1 – Foundations** → algebraic manipulation, functions, notation.
	- **M2 – Calculus** → differentiation, integration, and optimisation.
	- **M3 – Linear Algebra** → vectors, matrices, and transformations.
	- **M4 – Probability & Statistics** → distributions and inferential methods.
	- **M5 – Discrete Maths** → logic, combinatorics, and set theory.
	- **M6 – Numerical Methods** → approximation, convergence, and iterative methods.
	- **M7 – Advanced Probability & Stats** → multivariate analysis, estimation, regression, and Bayesian inference.  
- Each folder includes Markdown summaries integrating theoretical explanation with worked examples.

### -- Other --/
- **Exercises/** – additional problem sets and coding tasks for reinforcement.  
- **Templates/** – standardised note and folder structures ensuring consistency and reproducibility.  
- **Images/** – (previously included) diagrams and figures used for visual explanation.  
- **Reference Notes** – environment setup, learning order, and concept-specific summaries (e.g., PCA).
