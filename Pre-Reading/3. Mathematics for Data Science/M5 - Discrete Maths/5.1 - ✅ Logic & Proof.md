# Propositional Logic
## Propositions and truth values
- Proposition - a declarative statement that is either *true ($\top$)* or *false ($\bot$)*, but not both
	- $\top$ - logical truth (always true)
	- $\bot$ - logical falsehood (always false)
- Not all sentences are propositions
## Logical Connectives
- $\land$ - (AND): $P \land Q$ - true if both are true
- $\lor$ - (OR): $P \lor Q$ - true if at least one is true
- $\lnot$ - (NOT): $\lnot P$ - true if $P$ is false, and false if $P$ is true
- $\to$ - (IMPLIES): $P \to Q$ - "if P, then Q" - false only when $P$ is true and $Q$ is false (true if $P$ is false and $Q$ is false, check table below)
- $\leftrightarrow$ - (IF AND ONLY IF): $P \leftrightarrow Q$ - true if $P$ and $Q$ have the same truth value 
	- Different from $\land$ - two $\bot$ using $\leftrightarrow$ gives $\top$
## Truth tables
Systematic way to evaluate compound statements
### Example: $P \to Q$

| $P$    | $Q$    | $P \to Q$ |
| ------ | ------ | --------- |
| $\top$ | $\top$ | $\top$    |
| $\top$ | $\bot$ | $\bot$    |
| $\bot$ | $\top$ | $\top$    |
| $\bot$ | $\bot$ | $\top$    |
- $R_1$ - $P$ happened, $Q$ happened -> $\top$
- $R_2$ - $P$ happened, $Q$ did not -> $\bot$

To be false, statement would have to fail after "running":
- $R_3$ - $P$ did not, $Q$ did -> $\top$
- $R_4$ - $P$ did not, $Q$ did not -> $\top$
## Logical equivalence
Two statements always give the same truth value no matter what, e.g.:
- Statement 1: $\lnot(P \lor Q)$ - NOT($P$ or $Q$)
- Statement 2: $\lnot P \land \lnot Q$ - NOT($P$) and NOT($Q$)
Truth tables for each statement are identical for all possible values of $P$ and $Q$ -> logically equivalent
## Common equivalence laws
### De Morgan's Laws
How negation distributes over AND/OR
- $\neg (P \land Q) \equiv (\neg P \lor \neg Q)$ -> not in P and Q $\equiv$ not in P or not in Q or both
- $\neg (P \lor Q) \equiv (\neg P \land \neg Q)$ -> not in either P or Q $\equiv$ not in P and not in Q
### Distributive Laws
How AND distributes over OR, and vice versa
- $P \land (Q \lor R) \equiv (P \land Q) \lor (P \land R)$
- $P \lor (Q \land R) \equiv (P \lor Q) \land (P \lor R)$
### Associative Laws
You can regroup brackets without changing meaning
- $(P \lor Q) \lor R \equiv P \lor (Q \lor R)$
- $(P \land Q) \land R \equiv P \land (Q \land R)$
### Commutative Laws
You can swap the order of terms
- $P \land Q \equiv Q \land P$
- $P \lor Q \equiv Q \lor P$

# Predicate Logic
## Qualifiers: $\forall$ (for all), $\exists$ (there exists)
Quantifier: symbol in logic that tells you how many values of a variable make a predicate true
### Predicate
A statement involving variables, e.g., $P(x): x>0$
- Notation: $P(x)$ where $x$ is all variables
- Becomes a proposition when variables are all assigned values
	- E.g., $P(5)$ 
### Universal quantifier $\forall$
$\forall$ = for all
- E.g., $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, x^2>0$ -> for all real numbers $x$, $x^2$ is non-negative
### Essential qualifier $\exists$
$\exists$ = there exists
- E.g., $\exists x \in \mathbb{R}, x^2 = 25$ -> there exists a natural number $x$ such that $x^2$ equals 25
## Negation of quantified statements
### Negation flips between $\forall$ and $\exists$
- $\lnot(\forall P(x)) \equiv \exists x, \lnot P(x)$ -> "Not all $x$ satisfy $P$" $\equiv$ "There exists an $x$ that does not satisfy $P$"
- $\lnot(\exists P(x)) \equiv \forall x, \lnot P(x)$ -> "There does not exist an $x$ with property $P$" $\equiv$ "For all $x$, $P(x)$ is false"
### Examples of negation (contradictory pairs)
Negations are vital in proofs, especially proof by contradiction
- Statement: "All cars are electric"
	- $\forall x, Car(x) \to Electric(x)$
- Negation: "There exists at least one car that is not electric"
	- $\exists x, Car(x) \land \lnot Electric(x)$

- Statement: "There exists a student who has passed every exam"
	- $\exists x, Student(x) \land Passed All(x)$
- Negation: "Every student has failed at least one exam"
	- $\forall x, Student (x) \to \lnot PassedAll(x)$
## Translating between plain English and formal statements
Skill: rewrite natural language into symbolic logic (and back)
- Example translations:
	- "Every human is mortal" -> $\forall x, (Human(x)) \to Mortal (x))$
	- "Some integers are even" -> $\exists x \in \mathbb{Z}, Even(x)$ 
	- "No cats are dogs" -> $\forall x, (Cat(x) \to \lnot Dog(x)$
- Reverse
	- $\forall x, (P(x) \lor Q(x))$ -> "For every $x$, either $P$ is true or $Q$ is true"
	- $\exists x, (Prime(x) \land Even(x))$ -> "There exists an $x$ that is both prime and even" ($x=2$)
## Application to Data Science
- *Quantifiers* appear in algorithm design ("for all data points, compute error")
- *Negation* useful in database queries and filtering ("not all users clicked")
- *Translation* crucial in formalising real-world problems into precise statements before coding

# Methods of Proof
## Direct proof
### Idea
Assume hypothesis is true -> apply logical steps -> deduce conclusion
### Steps
- Assume $P$
- Use definitions, algebra, and known theorems
- Conclude $Q$
### Example: prove if $n$ is even, then $n^2$ is even
1. Let $n = 2k$
2. Then $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k)$, which is even
## Proof by contrapositive
### Idea
Prove $P \to Q$, prove instead $\lnot Q \to \lnot P$
- Often simpler when working with negations
### Example: prove if $n^2$ is odd then, then $n$ is odd
- Contrapositive (flip and negate both parts of implication)
	- if $n$ is even, then $n^2$ is even. Already proved directly above
Therefore statement is true
## Proof by contradiction
### Idea
Assume opposite of what you want to prove -> derive a contradiction
### Steps
- Assume $\lnot P$
- Deduce logical inconsistency
- Conclude $P$ must be true
### Example: prove $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational
- Assume $\sqrt{2} = \tfrac{a}{b}$ in lowest terms -> then 2 = $\tfrac{a^2}{b^2} \Rightarrow a^2 = 2b^2$
- $\therefore a$ is even -> $a = 2k$. Sub back in -> $b$ must also be even
- Contradiction: $\tfrac{a}{b}$ was assumed reduced. $\therefore \sqrt{2}$ must be irrational
Assumes $\sqrt{2} = \tfrac{a}{b}$ in lowest terms, proves both are even and can be reduced
## Proof by cases
### Idea
Break problem into cases, prove each separately, then combine
### Example: prove for any integer $n$, $n^2 \equiv 0 \ \text{or} \ 1 (\text{mod 4})$ 
Case 1:
- $n$ even -> $n = 2k$ -> $n^2 = 4k^2 \equiv 0 \  \text{mod 4}$
Case 2:
- $n$ odd -> $n = 2k + 1$ -> $n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \equiv 1 \ \text{(mod 4)}$
Done
## Constructive vs. non-constructive existence proofs
### Constructive proof: explicitly show an example
- Example: "There exists an even prime number" -> Construct $2$
### Non-constructive proof: show something must exist without giving an explicit example
- Example: prove $\exists$ irrational numbers $a, b$ such that $a^b$ is rational
	- Consider $a = \sqrt{2}, b = \sqrt{2}$ 
	- Either $(\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}}$ is rational (done), or irrational
	- If irrational, take $a = (\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}}, b = \sqrt{2}$
		- Then $a^b =\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}}$ = $(\sqrt{2})^2$ = 2
## Application to Data Science
- *Direct proofs* - verifying correctness of algorithms
- *Contrapositive* - useful in proving error bonds
- *Contradiction* - used in impossibility results
- *Cases* - in classification problems
- *Existence proofs* - optimisation (showing solution must exist, even if not explicitly found)

# Mathematical Induction
## Definition
### Mathematical induction
- A method to prove statements that are true for all natural numbers
- Induction used to prove some statement is true for all natural numbers (or integers in a sequence-like fashion)
## Standard induction
### Structure
1. Base case - prove statement is true for the first natural number (often $n=1$)
2. Inductive step - assume statement holds for $n=k$
3. Prove it holds for $n = k +1$
### Example: prove $\sum_{i=1}^n i = \tfrac{n(n+1)}{2}$
- Base case ($n=1$): LHS = 1, RHS = 1 ✅ 
- Inductive hypothesis: assume true for $n=k$
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k}i = \tfrac{k(k+1)}{2}
$$
- For $n=k+1$ - we want to prove $\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}i = \tfrac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}$
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}i = (\sum_{i=1}^{k}i) + (k+1)
$$
$$
\begin{array}{c}
=\tfrac{k(k+1)}{2}+(k+1) \\
=\tfrac{k(k+1)}{2}+\tfrac{2(k+1)}{2} \\ 
=\tfrac{k(k+1)+2(k+1)}{2} \\
\end{array}
$$
Which equals the formula for $n=k+1$
$$
\tfrac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}
$$
## Strong induction
### Difference to standard
- Instead of assuming only the case $n=k$, assume the statement holds up for all values up to $k$, then prove for $k+1$
- Needed when each new step relies on multiple previous steps
### Example: prove every integer $n \geq 2$ is either prime or a product of primes
- Base case: $n=2$ (prime) ✅
- Inductive step: assume true for all numbers $2 \leq m \leq k$
- Show for $n=k+1$
	- If $k+1$ prime -> ✅ 
	- If not -> $k+1=ab$ with $a,b < k +1$
		- As we have assumed $2 \leq m \leq k$ are all primes or products of primes - $\therefore$ $k+1=ab$ is also a product of primes
## Applications to Data Science
- *Induction* - reasoning tool for proving algorithm correctness
- *Strong induction* - used for recursive structures like trees or graph traversals
- *Inequalities proved by induction* - bounding error rates, convergence proofs
