# General Form of a System (Matrices Relation)
## General form of a system
$$
Ax = b
$$
- $A$ =coefficient matrix
- $x$ = vector of unknowns (column)
- $b$ = constants vector
## Relation to matrices
If a system is written as $Ax=b$ and $det(A) \neq 0$,
$$
x = A^{-1}b
$$
gives the unique solution (vector of unknowns)

If the determinant of the coefficient matrix is 0 then the system has zero (due to inconsistency) or infinite solutions

# Solving Methods
## Substitution/elimination
Substitution:
- Solve one equation for one variable, then plug it into other equations
Elimination:
- Add/subtract equations to eliminate one variable
## Matrix inverse method
Write the system as $Ax=b$
- If $A$ is a square matrix and invertible, solution is:
$$
x =A^{-1}b
$$
Inefficient and numerically unstable for large systems - rarely used in real software
## Gaussian elimination
The systemic, general method taught in linear algebra
Example:
$$
\begin{cases}
2x + y = 5 \\
x - y = 1
\end{cases}
$$
### Steps:
1. Write in coefficient matrix:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 2&1 &|&5 \\ 1&-1 &|&1 \end{bmatrix}
$$
2. Swap rows so the $1$ in the second row comes first
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1&-1 &|&1 \\ 2&1 &|&5 \end{bmatrix}
$$
3. Subtract $R_1$ twice from $R_2$ to get:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1&-1 &|&1 \\ 0&3 &|&3 \end{bmatrix}
$$
4. Therefore:
$$
y = 1
$$
5. Sub $y=1$ back in:
$$
\begin{array}{c}
x-y = 1 \\
x -(1) = 1 \\
\\
\therefore x = 2
\end{array}
$$
### Why used in software:
- Scales well to large systems
- More numerically stable than computing $A^{-1}$
- Efficient algorithms
## Pivots in Gaussian elimination
A pivot is the first nonzero number in a row when the matrix is in elimination form
### Example
Start with
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 2&1 \\ 4&3 \end{bmatrix}
$$
The pivot is the $2$ in $R_1$
1. Use that pivot to eliminate the number below it
$$
R_2 \rightarrow R_2 - 2R_1
$$
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 2&1 \\ 0&1 \end{bmatrix}
$$
2. Now the pivot in the second row is the $1$ in $R_2$
### Why important?
- The number of pivots = the rank of the matrix
- No pivot column = that variable is free

# Rank and Solutions
## Rank
Number of independent solutions
- In a matrix -> rank = number of linearly independent rows (or columns)
- In systems of equations -> rank states how many equations provide new information
## Rank vs. no. of unknowns
- $\rho = rank(A)$ -> rank
- $n$ -> no. of unknowns
- $nullity = \nu = n - rank(A)$ -> number of free variables
### Rank = no. of unknowns
- Exactly one solution (each unknown has one exact value)
- $\nu = 0$ (no free variables)
### Rank < no. of unknowns
- Infinitely many solutions
- $\nu > 0$
### Inconsistent system
- Equations contradict
- $\therefore$ no solution (regardless of rank/nullity)
- Lines are parallel -> if they were not, they would intersect at some point -> solution exists
When this is the case, regression finds approximate solutions (least squares)
## Geometric link - nullity and dimension of the solution space
Nullity = number of free variables = dimension of the solution space
- This is because when each unknown has not been pinned down to an exact value of its dimension -> it can take anything so the solution space occupies a range of values in the dimension
### Graphical demonstration:
![[output.png]]
## Rank link to Gaussian elimination
- Rank is found via Gaussian elimination by simplifying equations by row operations
- When it is finished, the number of nonzero rows is the rank
### Example:
$$
\begin{cases}
2x + 2y = 2 \\
x + y = 1
\end{cases}
$$
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 2&2&|&2\\ 1&1&|&1 \end{bmatrix}
$$
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1&1&|&1\\ 0&0&|&0 \end{bmatrix}
$$
$\therefore$ $\rho =1$
