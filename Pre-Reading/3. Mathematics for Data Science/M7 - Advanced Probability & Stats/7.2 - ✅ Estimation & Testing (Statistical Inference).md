# Intro/Definition
## Statistical Inference Definition
Statistical inference = drawing conclusions about a whole population using only a sample of the data. Two main tasks:
- Estimation
- Testing
## Estimation
### Idea
We rarely know the true population values. Instead, we collect a sample and estimate those values
### Parameters estimated
- Mean
- Variance
- Proportions (e.g., % of voters supporting a candidate)
### Estimates (continued in "Meaning in Probability and Statistics" section later in document)
- Point estimate
 - Interval estimate (confidence intervals)
### Why it matters in DS
- Model parameters are estimated from training data
- Gives us a way to generalise from data -> population or unseen cases
## Testing (Hypothesis Testing)
### Idea
- Check if a claim about a population parameter is supported by data
### Steps
1. **Start with a null hypothesis ($H_0$)**
	- Assumed no effect, no difference, nothing interesting happening
	- $H_0$ -> baseline claim, no effect
	- $H_1$ -> competing claim, effect exists
2. **Collect data and compute a test statistic**
	- Formula-based measure of difference
3. **Compare to a reference distribution to see if the result is extreme**
	- Extreme -> probability of data occurring is very low under the assumption that $H_0$ is true
	- This chance of occurrence under $H_0$ is called the $p$-value
	- Other test statistics can be used ($z, t, \chi^2,F$)
4. **Interpret data**
	- If data is very unlikely under $H_0$ -> reject $H_0$
	- Otherwise -> fail to reject $H_0$
### Why this matters in DS
- Used for feature selection (is a variable significant?)
- Model comparison (is one model better than another?)
- A/B testing in business and tech (does version B really improve outcomes?)
# Meaning in Probability & Statistics
## Estimation
### Point estimation
- A single "best guess" for a population parameter
- Example: the mean $\bar{x}$ of a sample population is used to estimate the true population mean ($\mu$)
### Interval estimation
- A range of plausible values, with a stated level of certainty
	- E.g., "the mean is between X and Y with 95% confidence"
- Confidence level comes from probability tables

# Application to Data Science
### Estimation
Gives you numbers for unknown things
- E.g., estimate the average income in a city using a sample
### Testing
Gives a decision about a claim
- E.g., test whether a new product really increases sales compared to the old one
### Together
- ML model validation -> estimating model accuracy, testing if it is significantly better than another model
- A/B testing in business -> comparing two website versions to see which performs better
- Medical trials -> estimating drug effects, then testing if the effect is real or due to chance
- Finance -> estimating risk parameters, then testing if a risk model is reliable
