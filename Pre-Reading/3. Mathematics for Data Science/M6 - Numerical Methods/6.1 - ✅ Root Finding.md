# Intro
## Definition/intro
A root (or zero) of a function is a value of $x$ where the function touches or crosses the x-axis
- $\equiv$ finding the $x$ intercept
### Relevance
- Quadratic equations
	- Roots give exact solutions
- Nonlinear equations
	- Roots may not have neat formulae - numerical methods used (algorithms)
- In DS
	- Underpins optimisation, regression, and ML algorithms
## Root of a Function
Definition: solve $f(x) = 0$
- Examples:
	- Quadratic root: solve $ax^2 + bc + c = 0$
	- Nonlinear root: e.g. $f(x) = cos(x) - x$
		- Can't solve exactly with algebra
		- ***==Must approximate numerically==***
## Fixed-point iteration
Sometimes instead of solving $f(x) = 0$ directly, we have to rewrite in the form
$$
x=g(x)
$$
(rearranging for $x$)
### Solving procedure:
1. Choose starting value $x_1$
2. Compute $x_{n+1} = g(x_n)$
3. Repeat until successive values $x_n$ converge on an approximate point
### Example 1: $cos(x) - x = 0$
1. Rearrange for $x$
$$
x = \cos(x)
$$
2. Solve for $x_2$ with initial value $x_1 = 0.5$ (0.5 as an example)
	- + iterate
$$
\begin{array} {c}
\cos(x_n) = x_{n+1} \\
\cos(0.5) \approx 0.8776 \\
\cos(\approx 0.8776) \approx 0.6390 \\
\cos(\approx 0.6390) \approx 0.8027\\
... \\
\cos(x_k) \approx 0.7391
\end{array}
$$
### Example 2: $f(x) = e^{-x} - x =0$
$$
\begin{array} {c}
\text{Rearrange: } e^{-x} = x \\ \\
\text{Solve}:\\
e^{-2} \approx 0.1353 \\
... \\
e \ \text{converges at } x = 0.5671
\end{array}
$$

# Numerical Methods
## Definition
Numerical methods:
- Step-by-step procedures (algorithms) for finding approximate solutions to mathematical problems when exact solutions are hard or impossible to get
## Bisection method
### Idea
- Narrow down where a root is by repeatedly halving an interval
### Requirements
- $f(x)$ must be continuous
- The function must have opposite signs at the interval end points
	- $f(a) \cdot f(b) < 0$ must mean there is a root between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$
		- This is because at the interval $[a,b]$, the y values must be either side of the x axis -> it has to cross the x axis -> a root exists
### Process (in example: $f(x) = x^3 - x -2$)
1. Rough guess
	- If $x=1$ -> $y=-2$
	- If $x=2$ -> $y=4$
	- Therefore the root falls between $[1,2]$
2. Compute midpoint
	- $m = \tfrac{1+2}{2}=1.5$
	- Sub back into $f(x)$ -> $(1.5)^3-1.5-2 = -0.125$ 
	- $m$ is negative
3. Interpret midpoint
	- If same sign as $a$ -> root is in $[m,b]$
	- If same sign as $b$ -> root is in $[a,m]$
	- $f(x)$ root is in $[1.5,2]$
4. Repeat
	- Next midpoint: $m = 1.75$, $f(1.75) = 1.6094 > 0$ -> root in $[1.5, 1.625]$ (lower half of $[1.5,2]$)
	- Next midpoint: $m = 1.625$, $f(1.625) = 0.666 > 0$ -> root in $[1.5, 1.625]$ (lower half of $[1.5,2]$)
	- Next midpoint: $m = 1.5625$, $f(1.5625) = 0.252 > 0$ -> root in $[1.5, 1.5625]$ (lower half of $[1.5,1.625]$)
	- Next midpoint: $m = 1.53125$, $f(1.53125) = 0.059 > 0$ -> root in $[1.5, 1.53125]$ (lower half of $[1.5, 1.5625]$)
	- Next midpoint: $m = 1.515625$, $f(1.515625) = -0.034 < 0$ -> root in $[1.515625, 1.53125]$ (upper half of $[1.5,1.53125]$)
Therefore root is in interval $[1.515625, 1.53125]$
## Newton-Raphson method
### Idea
- Use tangent lines to jump quickly to the root
Iteration formula:
$$
x_{x+1} = x_n - \tfrac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
$$
### Process
1. Start with guess $x_0$
2. Draw a tangent line at $(x_n, f(x_n))$
3. Where the tangent crosses the X-axis = next guess

- Pros:
	- Very fast convergence if starting guess is close to the root
- Cons: 
	- Needs derivative $f'(x)$
	- A poor guess can make it diverge
## Secant method
### Idea
- Like Newton-Raphson, but avoids computing the derivative
- Uses slope of the line through two recent points instead of the true tangent
- Iteration formula:
$$
x_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n)\tfrac{x_n - x_{n-1}}{f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1})}
$$
### Process and visualisation
1. Starting point
	- Pick two guesses, $x_0$ and $x_1$
2. Draw the secant line
	- Connect points with straight line
	- This line is the "fake tangent" - not real tangent but approximates the slope using two points
3. Find x-intercept of secant line
	- Extend that red line until it crosses x axis
	- The x-value of that crossing is new guess $x_2$
	- That becomes the next blue dot
4. Repeat
	- Take your last two guesses, $x_1$ and $x_2$
	- Draw a new secant line through
	- Find where it crosses the x-axis
Each step always uses the two most recent guesses

# Error and Convergence
## Absolute vs relative error
When approximating a root (or any numerical answer), you need to measure how close your approximation is to the true value
### Absolute error
$$
|x_{\text{approx}} - x_{\text{true}}|
$$
Just the raw difference
### Relative error
$$
\tfrac{|x_{\text{approx}}-x_{\text{true}}|}{x_\text{true}}
$$
Error as a proportion of the true value
## Order of convergence
How fast does an iterative method get closer to the root?
- Linear - reliable but slow
- Quadratic - much faster, but only if conditions are right (e.g., good starting guess)
### Linear convergence
- Error shrinks proportionally each step
- E.g., bisection (cuts interval in half each time)
### Quadratic convergence
- Error shrinks much faster (roughly squares each step)
- E.g., Newton-Raphson near the root
## Why initial guess matters
For methods like the NR or FPI, the starting guess $x_0$ can decide:
- If the method converges at all
- Which root is converges to (if there are multiple)
- How fast it converges

# Applications in Data Science
### Optimisation
- Minimise/maximise a cost function, set its derivative = 0
- Root-finding methods locate where slope is zero 
### Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
- MLE often requires solving $\tfrac{d}{d\theta}\log L(\theta)=0$ 
- Root-finding is used to get parameter estimates
### Logistic regression and iterative solvers
- Logistic regression has no closed-form solution
- Iterative root-finding methods (like NR) are used to solve for parameters
