# Intro
## Combinatorics
Combinatorics studies discrete structures by asking questions like:
- How many different passwords of length 8 can be made from letters and digits?
- In how many ways can you seat 5 people around a table?
- How many different 2-card hands can be drawn from a standard deck?
Counting possibilities without listing them all

# Counting Principles
## Rule of sum and rule of product
Avoids brute force listing
### Rule of sum (additive principle - either/or)
- If $\exists$ $m$ ways to do one thing and $n$ ways to do another, given they cannot happen at the same time, there are $m+n$ possible choices
### Rule of product (multiplicative - and/then)
- Sequential task - first thing has $m$ ways, second thing has $n$ ways
	- $m \times n$ total possibilities
## Factorials
Counts how many ways we can arrange objects in order
$$
n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ ... \ \times \ 2 \times 1
 $$
Factorials and the additive/multiplicative rules are the foundations for combinatorics

# Permutations (order matters)
## Basic permutations + definition
A permutation = an ordering of objects
- If you have $n$ distinct objects, the number of ways to arrange them in a line is:
$$
n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ ... \ \times \ 2 \times 1
$$
## Permutations with repetition
### If some objects are identical:
We must divide by the number of repeated arrangements that look the same
$$
\tfrac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...n_k!}
$$
- $n$ -> total objects
- $n_1, n_2, ... n_k$ -> counts of each repeated type
### Examples
- `BOOK` - (4 letters)
	- Total = $4! = 24$
	- `O` appears twice - divide by $2!$
	- Unique permutations = $\tfrac{4!}{2!} =12$
- `BALLOON` (7 letters)
	- Total = $7! = 5040$
	- Formula = $\tfrac{7!}{2! \times 2!} = \tfrac{5040}{4} = 1260$

Uniqueness:
$$
\begin{array}{c}
B_1, A_1, L_1, L_2, O_1, O_2, N_1 \\
\text{and} \\
B_1, A_1, L_2, L_1, O_1, O_2, N_1 \\
\text{are the exact same permutation} \ (L_1 \ \text{and} \ L_2 \ \text{swapped})
\end{array}
$$
## Relevance
- *Basic permutations* -> arrangements when everything is distinct
- *With repetition* -> realistic situations (words, datasets, repeated values)
- These ideas underpin later topics

# Combinations (order does not matter)
>[!note] Note
>This section assumes no duplicity -> duplicity in combinations is shown inside [[4.2 - ✅ Random Variables]] - hypergeometric and multinomial distributions
## Basic combinations
How many ways to choose a group of $r$ objects from $n$ total objects, when order inside the group is irrelevant?
$$
\begin{pmatrix} n \\ r \end{pmatrix} = \tfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$
- $n$ -> total number of distinct objects
- $r$ -> how many you are choosing
### Examples
- From 10 students, choose 3 for a committee:
	- $\begin{pmatrix} 10 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \tfrac{10!}{3!7!}=120$
- From 5 books, choose 2 to read:
	- $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \tfrac{5!}{2!3!}=10$
## Combinations with repetition
Allowing picking the same object $>$ once
- Formula:
$$
\begin{pmatrix} n+r -1 \\ r \end{pmatrix}
$$
- $n$ -> number of distinct objects (sometimes categories)
- $r$ -> number of items chosen (with repeats allowed)
### Examples
- 3 flavours of ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry). Choose 2 scoops:
	- $\begin{pmatrix} 3+2-1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} =6$
	- Possibilites: VV, CC, SS, VC, VS, CS
- 5 types of fruit. Choose 3 fruits (allowing repeats)
	- $\begin{pmatrix} 5+3-1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 35$

# Binomial Theorem (tri/polynomials appear in probability)
>[!note] Note
>- Binomial expansion assumes equal weights -> $(x+y)^3$
>- Binomial distribution takes probabilistic weights -> $(0.2x+0.8y)^3$
## Expansion formula
Expanding powers of a sum (e.g., $x+y^3$)
$$
(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} x^{n-k} -y^k
$$
- The sum runs over all possible ways of choosing how many times $y$ appears in the product
- $n$ -> original exponent
- $k$ -> index of the sum
## Examples and interpretation
### Example 1
1. Expand $(x+y)^3$
$$
(x+y)^3 = \begin{pmatrix} 3\\0 \end{pmatrix}x^3 + \begin{pmatrix} 3\\1 \end{pmatrix}x^2y + \begin{pmatrix} 3\\2 \end{pmatrix}xy^2 + \begin{pmatrix} 3\\3 \end{pmatrix}y^3
$$
$$\to$$
$$
1x^3 + 3x^2y + 4xy^2 + 1y^3
$$
>[!note] Note
>- These coefficients use $\begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} = \tfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!})$ from the basic combinations formula
>- However, pascal's triangle can be used for finding coefficients:

2. Interpret
	- $1x^3$ -> combinations of picking $x$ 3/3 times = 1
	- $3x^2y$ -> combinations picking $x$ 2/3 times and $y$ 1 time = 3
	- Etc.
# Advanced (but core)
## Inclusion-exclusion principle
When sets overlap, if you add the sizes you end up double-counting the overlap. Therefore:
### For 2 sets:
$$
|A\cup B| = |A| + |B| -|A \cap B|
$$
### For 3 sets:
$$
|A \cup B \cup C| = |A|+|B|+|C| - |A \cap B| -|A \cap C| - |B \cap C| +|A \cap B \cap C|
$$
### Example : in a class:
- 20 study maths
- 15 study CS
- 10 study both
$$
|A \cup B| = 20 +15 -10 =25
$$
## Pigeonhole principle
If you put more than $n$ objects into $n$ boxes, at least one contains 2 or more objects
- If $N$ objects are placed into $k$ boxes, at least one box has at least $\lceil \tfrac{N}{k} \rceil$ objects ($\lceil \tfrac{N}{k} \rceil$ is always $\geq 2$)
Often used for proofs of existence (showing something MUST happen, even if you don't know exactly where)
# Applications in Data Science
- *Counting subsets and partitions* -> combinatorics tells you how many ways you can split, group, or subset datasets
- *Binomial coefficients in probability distributions* -> terms show up in distributions like binomial and hypergeometric
- *Pigeonhole principle* -> hashing, collisions -> if you may many data points into fewer has buckets, some must collide
- *Inclusion-exclusion in prob. calculations* -> used to correctly count probabilities of unions of overlapping events
