# Sets
## Basics
Set - a well-defined collection of distinct objects (elements or members) ($A =$ {$1,2,3$})
- Membership - $x \in A$
- Non-membership - $x \notin A$
- Empty set - $\varnothing$ 
- Universal set - $U$ - set containing all objects under consideration
## Set operations
- Union - $\cup$
- Intersection - $\cap$
- Difference - $\setminus$ - elements in one set but not the other
	- $A \setminus B = \{x:x \in A \ \text{and} \ x \notin B\}$ - elements in A but not B
- Complement - $A^c$ - all elements in the universal set not in $A$
## Properties of sets
### Commutative laws
- $A \cup B = B \cup A$
- $A \cap B = B \cap A$
### Associative laws
- $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$
- $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$
### Distributive laws
- $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$
- $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$
### De Morgan's laws (for complements)
- $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$
- $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$
## Special sets
- $\mathbb{N}$ - natural numbers ($1,2,3,...$) (sometimes includes 0)
- $\mathbb{Z}$ - integers ($...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...$)
- $\mathbb{Q}$ - rationals ($\tfrac{p}{q}$ where $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}, q \neq 0$)
- $\mathbb{R}$ - real numbers (rationals + irrationals, e.g. $\pi, \sqrt{2}$)
- Subsets - $A \subseteq B$ - every element of $A$ also in $B$ ($A$ is subset)
- Power set - ($\mathcal{P}(A)$) - the set of all subsets $A$
	- Subset = any combination of elements from $A$. E.g., $A = \{1,2\}$:
		- $\mathcal{P}(A) = \{\varnothing, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\}\}$
- Cardinality - the number of elements in a set, denoted $|A|$
	- For infinite sets, cardinality distinguishes different sizes of infinity ($|\mathbb{N}|,|\mathbb{R}|$) - types of infinity:
		- Countably infinite
			- $\aleph_0$ (aleph-null) - countable if elements can be put in one-to-one correspondence with natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$
		- Uncountably infinite
			- 
## Application to Data Science
- *Sets* - formalise datasets
- *Union* - combining datasets
- *Intersection* - common elements
- *Difference* - filtering
- *Cardinality* - size of datasets
- *Special sets* - appear in defining domains (e.g., integer counts, real-valued features)
# Relations
## Cartesian product
Cartesian product - the set of all ordered pairs of sets $A$ and $B$:
$$
A \times B = \{(a,b): a \in A, b \in B\}
$$
### Example:
If $A=\{1,2\}, B = \{x,y\}$, then
$$
A \times B = (\{(1,x), (1,y), (2,x), (2,y)\})
$$
### Relations as subsets
A relation is picking out pairs of the Cartesian product - kind of like a filter
- Taking all pairs $\mapsto$ choose some that follow a rule. E.g.:
$$
R = \{(a,b) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}: a<b\}
$$
This means:
- Take all pairs $(a,b)$ where $a$ is less than $b$
- $R$ -> relation
- $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ -> "these pairs come from the Cartesian product of natural numbers themselves"
## Properties of relations
### Reflexive
- A relation $R$ on set $A$ is reflexive if every element is related to itself - formally $(a,a) \in R$ for all $a \in A$
	- Take $R = \{(a,b) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}: a \leq b\}$ 
		- This is reflexive as $\in \mathbb{N}$, $a \leq a$
### Symmetric
- $R$ is symmetric if $(a,b) \in \mathbb{R} \Rightarrow (b,a) \in \mathbb{R}$ 
	- E.g., $a$ is a sibling of $b$ is symmetric - $b$ is also a sibling of $a$
### Transitive
- $R$ is transitive if $(a,b) \in \mathbb{R}$ and $(b,c) \in \mathbb{R} \Rightarrow (a,c) \in \mathbb{R}$
	- "Whenever $a$ is related to $b$, and $b$ is related to $c$ -> $a$ must also be related to $c$"
### Antisymmetric
- $R$ is antisymmetric if $(a,b) \in \mathbb{R}$ and $(b,a) \in \mathbb{R} \Rightarrow a = b$
	- E.g., suppose $a \leq b$ and $b \leq a$
		- The only way both can be true is if $a=b$
			- $\therefore$ , $\leq$ is antisymmetric
## Equivalence relations
### Definition
- A relation is an equivalence relation if it satisfies three properties at the same time:
	- Reflexive
	- Symmetric
	- Transitive
- An equivalence relation allows us to treat many objects as if they were the same, simplifying problems
### Partitions induced by equivalence relations
- An equivalence relation naturally groups elements together into equivalence classes
- Each class is just a group of elements that are equivalent to each other. E.g.,:
	- $[0] = \{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,...\}$
	- $[1] = \{...,-5,-2,1,4,7,...\}$
	- $[2] = \{...,-4,-1,2,5,8,...\}$
## Application to Data Science
- *Relations*- formalise connections between data
- *Properties* - matter in graph/network analysis
	- Reflexive -> self-loops
	- Symmetric -> undirected edges
	- Transitive -> hierarchical structures
- *Equivalence relations and partitions* - underpin clustering
# Functions
## Definition
- A function $f$ from set $A$ to set $B$ is a rule that assigns exactly one element of $B$ to each element of $A$
	- Notation: $f: A \to B$
	- $A$ is the domain (all possible inputs)
		-  E.g., if $f(x) = \tfrac{1}{x}$, then domain is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$
	- $B$ is the codomain (the set in which the outputs live)
	- The range is the subset of the codomain actually attained by applying $f$ to elements of the domain
		- The actual outputs that the function produces when you use every input in the domain
### Example
Let $f(x) = X^2$ with domain $\mathbb{R}$
- Domain: $\mathbb{R}$ -> you can input any real number
- Codomain: $\mathbb{R}$  -> by definition, outputs must be real numbers
- Range: $[0,\infty]$
### Function notation
- Standard notation $f: A \to B, x \mapsto f(x)$
- Example: $f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}, f(x) = 2x+1$
	- "$f$ is a function from integers to integers, mapping $x$ to $2x+1$"
## Types of functions
### Injective
One-to-one -> different inputs give different outputs
$$
f(x_1) = f(x_2) \Rightarrow x_1 = x_2
$$
Example: $f(x) = 2x+3$ -> $f(1) =5$, $f(2) = 7$ -> injective
### Surjective
Onto -> for every possible output $y$ in the codomain, there exists at least one input $x$ in the domain such that $f(x) = y$ 
$$
\forall y \in \text{codomain}, \exists x \in \text{domain} \ \text{such that} f(x) = y
$$
### Bijective
One-to-one and onto -> both injective and surjective
- Different inputs give different outputs (injective)
- Every possible output is hit by some input (surjective)
This means:
- Bijective functions have a true inverse
- Perfect pairing between domain and codomain - no duplicates, no gaps
E.g., $f(x) = x+1$ with domain and codomain $\mathbb{R}$
## Function composition and inverses
### Composition
Applying one function after another 
$$
(f\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))
$$
- Example:
- If $g(x) = x+2$ and $f(x) = x^2$, then $(f\circ g)(x) = (x+2)^2$
### Inverse function
Reverses mapping $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$
- Exists only if $f$ is bijective
- E.g., $f(x) = 3x +1 \Rightarrow f^{-1}y = \tfrac{y-1}{3}$
## Special functions
### Identity function
Returns the input unchanged
$$
I(x) = x
$$
### Constant function
No matter what input $x$ is, the output is always the same constant $c$
- Flat line function - graphed as a horizontal line
$$
f(x) = c
$$
### Floor and ceiling functions
Floor $\lfloor x \rfloor$
- Gives the largest integer $\leq x$
	- E.g.: $\lfloor 2.7 \rfloor = 2$
	- E.g.: $\lfloor -2.7 \rfloor = -3$
Ceiling $\lceil x \rceil$
- Gives smallest integer $\geq x$
	- E.g.: $\lceil 2.7 \rceil = 3$
	- E.g.: $\lceil -2.7 \rceil = -2$
## Application to Data Science
- *Injective/surjective/bijective* -> model mapping properties (unique predictions, covering output space)
- *Composition* -> pipeline of transformations
- *Inverses* -> decoding/transforming back (log-transform, normalisation)
- *Special functions* -> rounding, encoding categories, identity transforms and models
