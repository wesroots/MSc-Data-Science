## Key values to know

|  Radians  | Degrees | $cos(x)$ | $sin(x)$ |
| :-------: | :-----: | :------: | :------: |
|    $0$    |  $0º$   |   $1$    |   $0$    |
| $\pi / 2$ |  $90º$  |   $0$    |   $1$    |
|   $\pi$   | $180º$  |   $-1$   |   $0$    |
| $3\pi /2$ | $270º$  |   $0$    |   $-1$   |
|  $2\pi$   | $360º$  |   $1$    |   $0$    |
Remember:
$$
tan(x) = \tfrac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}
$$
