# Intro/Definition
## Regression
Regression -> a statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent variable (outcome) and one or more independent variables

# Meaning in Probability and Statistics
## Simple Linear Regression
- **Goal**: to predict a response variable $y$ using one predictor $x$
- Relationship assumed to be a straight line:
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x+ \varepsilon
$$
Where:
- $\beta_0$ -> $x$ intercept
- $\beta_1$ -> gradient
- $\varepsilon$ -> random error (variation not explained by $x$)
## Multiple Regression
- Extends the idea to several predictors:
$$
y = \beta_0 = \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2+...+\beta_px_p+\varepsilon
$$
- Each $\beta_i$ shows the weight of a predictor $x_i$ (feature)
- Each $x_i$ is one dimension (feature, predictor, variable)
	- $y$ does not count as a dimension - it is the response/output/target (aspect to predict)
	- Simple linear regression (1D predictor):
		- $y=\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\varepsilon$
	- Multiple regression (2D predictor):
		- $y=\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\varepsilon$
- E.g., predicting house price $y$ from size $\beta_1$, number of bedrooms $\beta_2$, and location $\beta_3$
## Key Statistical Ideas
### Estimating parameters $\beta_i$
- Found using least squares - chooses the line-plane that best fits the data
### Interpreting coefficients
- Each $\beta_i$ shows the effect size, how much the outcome changes when the predictor increases by one unit (weight)
### Assessing model fit
- $R^2$ -  proportion of variation in $y$ explained by the predictors
- Residuals - differences between observed values and predicted values

# Application in Data Science
### Regression is fundamental
- It's one of the most widely used tools in statistics and DS
### Applications
- Predicting continuous outcomes
	- E.g., house prices, stock returns, estimate sales
- Interpreting relationships
	- E.g., understanding how hours studied affects exam score or how advertising spend affects sales
- Foundation for advanced models
	- Many ML methods are extensions of regression
