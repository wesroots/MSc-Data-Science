## Notation
- Indefinite: $\int f(x) dx$
- Definite: $\int_a^b f(x) dx$

# Rules of Integration
## Rules
- Power rule - increase by power, divide by new power
## Exponential and log:
- $\int e^{nx} dx = \tfrac{e^nx}{n} + C$
- $\int \tfrac{1}{x}dx = ln|x| +C$
## Trig functions:
- $\int \sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C$
- $\int \cos(x)dx = sin(x) + C$
