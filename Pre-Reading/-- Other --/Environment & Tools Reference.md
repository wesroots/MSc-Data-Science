# 1. IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)
**Where code is written, run and managed**
## Jupyter Notebook
- ==Use:== Interactive coding with visual output
- ==Ideal for:== Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), quick experimentation, visualisations
- ==Pros:== Easy to use, visual feedback
- ==Example use== Python + Pandas to plot trends in stock or clinical data
## VS Code
- ==Use:== General-purpose, lightweight code editor
- ==Ideal for:== Full projects, version control, larger databases
- ==Pros:== Extensions for Python, Git, Jupyter
- ==Example use:== Writing and debugging ML models across multiple files
## PyCharm
- ==Use:== Professional Python IDE, powerful but heavy
- ==Ideal for:== Large codebases, when you need deep debugging or profiling
- ==Pros:== Strong autocomplete, refactoring, navigation
- ==Example use:== Working on a large-scale Python project with lots of files, classes, dependencies
# 2. Tools & Platforms
**Interfaces and services used for accessing or managing data, training models and building solutions**
## Quandl
- ==Use:== Pulling real-time or historical financial/economic data
- ==Use case:== Importing stock market or economic indicators in to a data pipeline
## Google Colab
- ==Use:== Free cloud-based Jupyter environment
- ==Pros:== No install needed, GPU/TPU support
- ==Use case:== Running heavy deep learning notebooks
## Anaconda
- ==Use:== Python/R distrubution with package & environment manager
- ==Use case:== Simplified installation of libraries and tools
## Git & GitHub
- ==Use:== Version control and collaboration
- ==Use case:==Managing code changes, working with teammates on project
# 3. Python Libraries
**Toolkits that do the work - e.g., visualising data, running regressions, training AI models**
## Pandas
- ==Use:== Tabular data manipulation (like Excel or SQL) using DataFrames and Series
	- Dataframe: all data - formatted by uncleaned
- ==Use case==: Handling messy Excel/CVS data, generating stats
## NumPy
- ==Use:== Efficient mathematical operations, fast large array handling
- ==Use case:== Behind-the-scenes of Pandas and ML models
## Matplotlib / Seaborn
- ==Use:== Graphical data visualisation
- ==Use case:== Plotting trends, histograms, correlations
## Scikit-learn
- ==Use:== Classic ML models (regression, classification, clustering)
- ==Use case:== Training a model to predict patient outcomes based on inputs
## TensorFlow / PyTorch
- ==Use:== Deep learning frameworks - more powerful than SKL - bigger projects
- ==Use case:== Building and training neural networks (especially in deep learning module)
## Statsmodels
- ==Use:== Statistical models (e.g., linear regression, hypothesis testing)
- ==Use case:== More advanced statistical analysis
## R (circumstantially - Foundations of Data Science module)
- ==Use:== Statistical computing and graphics
- ==Use case:== Foundations of Data Science module - for hypothesis testing, probability, etc.

# 4. Machine Learning / Deep Learning
**Using algorithms to find patterns & make predictions from data, including both traditional ML and neural networks**
- ==Neural network:== set of layered mathematical functions inspired by the brain (rough metaphor), which learn to make predictions or classifications by adjusting parameters through training
## Keras (with TensorFlow)
- ==Use:== High-level API for building deep neural networks
- ==Use case:== Quick prototyping of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) / MultilayerPerceptrons (MLP) models
## Bayesian Libraries (e.g., PyMC, Edward, Stan)
- ==Use:== Probabilistic modelling
- ==Use case:== Bayesian Machine Learning module - e.g., posterior distribution estimation (Bayesian concept)
## XGBoost / LightGBM
- ==Use:== Gradient boosting decision trees
- ==Use case:== Tabular data problems with better performance

# 5. Project Tools
**Useful for consultancy or dissertation module**
## Power BI / Tableau 
- ==Use:== Dashboard and report building
- ==Use case:== Presenting insights visually to stakeholder
## LaTeX or Overleaf
- ==Use:== High-quality scientific writing/reporting - better than Word for formatting, mathematics, etc.
- ==Use case:== Final project or research report formatting

# 6. Data Sources
## Kaggle
- Competition and data set platform
## UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Classic ML datasets to compare ML models
## OpenML, Google Dataset Search, Data.gov
- General datasets
