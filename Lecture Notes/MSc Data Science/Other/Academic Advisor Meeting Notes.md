# 1. Performance Evidence
**Purpose:** Establish that your competence and preparation are measurable.
## Talking Points
- “I did structured pre-reading before the MSc—Python (OOP, testing, modules), linear algebra, probability, optimisation.”
- “I’ve maintained detailed notes and projects in Obsidian and GitHub to demonstrate reproducible workflows.”
- “I’d like to understand how best to evidence independent work for employability and supervisor matching.”
## Tips
- Bring your GitHub link or screenshots of repositories.  
- Show structure, not volume: one concise visual (folder hierarchy or README).  
- Emphasise process maturity—version control, documentation, testing.  

# 2. Strategic Positioning
**Purpose:** Make the advisor aware that you aim to operate at the top percentile and want constructive oversight, not rescue.
## Talking Points
- “My long-term path is data science in finance. I’m aligning coursework, projects, and dissertation to that domain.”  
- “What indicators separate distinction-level students from merit-level in this program?”  
- “How are supervisors usually assigned? I’d like one comfortable with quantitative finance or computational modelling.”  
## Tips
- Don’t frame ambition emotionally (“I’m worried about peers”)—frame as efficiency (“I want to optimise module alignment and supervisor fit”).  
- Ask for reading or datasets used by past high-achieving students.  

# 3. Group Project Management
**Purpose:** Establish expectations before conflict arises.
## Talking Points
- “I aim for rigorous documentation, code reproducibility, and balanced workload distribution.”  
- “If contribution imbalances arise, is there a formal reporting process, or should I contact you directly as advised in lecture?”  
- “What evaluation criteria weigh individual vs. group performance?”  
## Tips
- Avoid naming peers now. Discuss systems, not people.  
- State that you want to pre-empt friction by clarifying grading mechanics.  
- Ask if project management tools (Git, Trello, etc.) are assessed or optional.  

# 4. Relationship Building
**Purpose:** Make him remember your competence without overt signalling.
## Talking Points
- Ask one question that demonstrates curiosity beyond the syllabus:  
  *“How do you see foundations of data science evolving with current LLM or time-series techniques?”*  
- Mention how his lectures link to your self-initiated projects:  
  *“I implemented your dataset cleaning principles on Yahoo Finance data to test reproducibility.”*  
## Tips
- Listen more than you talk; nod, take notes.  
- End by summarising next concrete step:  
  *“I’ll email my repo link and proposed dissertation directions once I refine them.”*  

# 5. Meeting Logistics
**Bring:**
- Printed one-page summary: goals, pre-reading topics mastered, projects done, short-term objectives.  
- Notebook with a bullet list of questions and blank space for answers.  
- One concise visual or dashboard printout from your Obsidian or GitHub workspace.  

**Duration:** 20–25 min  
**Priority Order:**  
1. Goals  
2. Project management  
3. Dissertation alignment  
4. Career fit  

**Closing Line:**  
*“Would you prefer updates by email or during office hours?”* — signals accountability.
