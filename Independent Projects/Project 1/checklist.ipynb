    "## Data Project Workflow Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify data source and confirm credibility.\n",
    "* Determine retrieval method (API, file, web scrape, etc.).\n",
    "* Confirm data covers required time period or scope.\n",
    "* Save raw data in an unaltered state for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "* Review dataset structure visually.\n",
    "* Confirm rows represent observations and columns represent variables.\n",
    "* Verify data types correspond to expected meanings (numeric, categorical, date, text).\n",
    "* Check indexing (unique identifiers or datetime consistency).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structure validation:** confirm shape and logical organisation.\n",
    "* **Completeness:** identify missing values; decide whether to drop, fill, or impute.\n",
    "* **Duplicates:** detect and remove identical records.\n",
    "* **Range and logic validation:** confirm values fall within realistic limits and obey logical relationships.\n",
    "* **Format standardisation:** align units, date formats, and naming conventions.\n",
    "* **Outlier inspection:** detect extreme values and decide if they are valid or errors.\n",
    "* **Consistency check:** ensure repeated entries or grouped data match across fields.\n",
    "* **Documentation:** record every modification to maintain reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Data Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Select relevant columns for analysis.\n",
    "* Create derived metrics (returns, ratios, percentages, rolling means, etc.).\n",
    "* Rename columns for clarity.\n",
    "* Change data frequency (daily to monthly, etc.) if needed.\n",
    "* Merge or join related datasets when multiple sources are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, range, variance, correlations).\n",
    "* Identify relationships and trends through summary tables.\n",
    "* Plot visual summaries (line charts, bar charts, histograms, boxplots, scatter plots).\n",
    "* Note any unexpected behaviours or patterns for follow-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Analysis and Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define clear questions or hypotheses.\n",
    "* Choose analytical or statistical methods aligned with the goal.\n",
    "* Validate assumptions for chosen techniques.\n",
    "* Compare alternative methods if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Interpretation and Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "* Translate numerical or visual results into plain-language conclusions.\n",
    "* Quantify uncertainty or confidence in findings.\n",
    "* Identify limitations or data caveats.\n",
    "* Relate results to the original goal or question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Presentation and Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create clean visualisations suitable for the intended audience.\n",
    "* Annotate charts with context, labels, and explanations.\n",
    "* Organise findings logically within a notebook or report.\n",
    "* Export clean figures and datasets for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Archival and Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "* Save final cleaned datasets and scripts separately from raw data.\n",
    "* Document environment, package versions, and processing steps.\n",
    "* Maintain versioned storage (e.g., Git or local copies).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This checklist applies to all data projects regardless of language or platform. It ensures complete workflow coverage before, during, and after analysis.\n"
