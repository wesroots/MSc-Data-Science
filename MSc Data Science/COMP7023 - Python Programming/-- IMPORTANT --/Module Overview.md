>[!example] Overview
> This module builds essential programming skills through Python, with no prior coding assumed.  
> It frames programming as a problem-solving tool across AI, machine learning, web technologies, and finance.  
>  
> **Focus areas:**  
> - Core programming principles: variables, control flow, functions, data structures  
> - Structured problem analysis and reduction to coding tasks  
> - Testing and verification of solutions  
> - Awareness of performance trade-offs in program design  
>  
> **Learning outcomes:**  
> - Create computer programs in Python  
> - Critically analyse problems and translate them into code  
> - Test and verify programming solutions effectively  
> - Apply understanding of performance trade-offs when designing solutions
