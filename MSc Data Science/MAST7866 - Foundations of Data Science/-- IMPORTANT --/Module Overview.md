>[!example] Overview
> This module develops the statistical and computing foundations required for advanced study in data science.  
> It assumes minimal prior experience in mathematics or programming and builds the skills needed to apply modern data analysis methods effectively.  
>  
> **Focus areas:**  
> - Introductory probability, hypothesis testing, and basic statistics  
> - Programming for data analysis using R  
> - Data visualisation and interpretation  
> - Linear regression and multivariable prediction  
> - Communication, presentation, and ethical considerations in data science  
>  
> **Learning outcomes:**  
> - Solve real-world problems using probability and statistical techniques  
> - Integrate programming skills in R with conceptual understanding of data science  
> - Apply statistical methods such as linear regression to unseen datasets  
> - Exercise sound judgment with complex or ambiguous data  
> - Communicate findings clearly in written and oral formats
