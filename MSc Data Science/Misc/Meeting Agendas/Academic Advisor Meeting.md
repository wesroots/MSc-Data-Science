# 1. Performance Evidence
**Purpose:** Establish competence and preparation
## Main Points
- Structured pre-reading before the MSc - Python (OOP, testing, modules), linear algebra, probability, optimisation
- Detailed notes and projects in Obsidian and GitHub - demonstrates reproducible workflows
- Want to understand how best to evidence independent work for employability and supervisor matching
## Note:
- Bring GitHub link or screenshots of repositories
- Listen more than talk - notes
- Structure over volume: one concise visual (folder hierarchy or README)
- Process maturity - version control, documentation, testing

# 2. Strategic Positioning
**Purpose:** Inform advisor my aim is to operate at top percentile and desire constructive oversight
## Main Points
- Long-term path is data science in finance aligning coursework, projects, and dissertation
- "What indicators separate distinction-level students from merit-level in this program?"
## Note:
- Frame ambition as efficiency -> optimise module alignment and supervisor fit
- Reading or datasets used by past high-achieving students (projects?)

# 3. Group Project Management
**Purpose:** Establish expectations
## Main Points
- Thorough documentation, code reproducibility, balanced workload distribution  
- Evaluation criteria - individual vs. group performance

# 5. Meeting Summary
**Bring:**
- Summary: goals, pre-reading topics mastered, projects done, short-term objectives
- One concise visual or dashboard printout from your Obsidian or GitHub workspace 

**Priority Order:**  
1. Goals  
2. Project management  
3. Dissertation alignment  
4. Career fit
