# 1. Purpose and Context
- **Clarify objective** - seeking dissertation supervision and guidance on aligning independent and assessed work with financial data science.  
- **Briefly restate background:**  
	- MSc Data Science (finance-oriented direction)  
	- GitHub portfolio development (structure, reproducibility, workflow maturity)  
	- Independent project: *Evaluating the Risk–Return Performance of AAPL and MSFT in 2024*  
# 2. Dissertation Supervision and Research Scope
## Possible Research Themes
- Machine learning models for stock or portfolio prediction  
- Financial time-series forecasting (volatility, trend, or anomaly detection)  
## Key Questions
- Which themes best fit current work or interest area?  
- What data sources are realistic and permissible for a dissertation?  
- How much freedom do students have in defining research direction?  
- What scope and depth are typical for a distinction-level MSc dissertation?
# 3. Project Methodology Guidance
## Discussion Points
- Appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, MSE, hit rate, directional accuracy)
- How to integrate code (GitHub), results, and written report cohesively
# 4. Skill and Portfolio Development
## Focus Areas
- Confirm current portfolio structure demonstrates workflow management  
- How to strengthen the “research credibility” of your GitHub repo  
	- Documentation expectations  
	- Standards for code readability and commenting  
	- How to include small experiments or notebooks linked to dissertation prep  
# 5. Supervision Logistics
## Clarify
- Expected communication frequency (email, Teams, office hours)
# 6. Career and Academic Alignment
## Discussion Points
- Relevance of financial ML research for roles like:
	- Quantitative data analyst
	- ML researcher in fintech
	- Risk modelling or forecasting roles
