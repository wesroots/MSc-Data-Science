# Modules Directory
Each folder mirrors the Obsidian vault layout used for MSc study organisation, including individual projects and independent pre-reading.  

Inside each module, material is organised uniquely due to module structure.

All changes made locally in Obsidian are automatically committed and pushed to this GitHub repository using the integrated **Git Obsidian plugin**, ensuring continuous synchronisation between local and remote versions.
