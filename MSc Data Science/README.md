# Modules Directory
Each folder mirrors the Obsidian vault layout used for MSc study organisation, including individual projects and independent pre-reading.  
Inside each module, material is organised uniquely due to module structure.

---

### Each note type begins with a short description at the top of the page.
- **Lecture Notes** - Summarise key concepts and reasoning from lectures/seminars.
- **PC – Syntax Breakdown** - Explain R/Python syntax and logic from weekly PC sessions.
- **Module Work** - Contain datasets, scripts, and outputs for assessed work.
